# loon

Super fast Python toolkit for operating remote host based on SSH.

## Description

Idea for developing **loon** comes from [sync-deploy](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sync-deploy), which help me run commands, copy and download files on/to/from remote host. This toolkit is built on the top of [ssh2-python library](https://github.com/ParallelSSH/ssh2-python).

## Note

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.2. For details and usage
information on PyScaffold see https://pyscaffold.org/.
