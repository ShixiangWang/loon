## Description

**loon** is a Python toolkit for operating remote host based on SSH. Idea for developing **loon** comes from [**sync-deploy**](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sync-deploy), which is limited by its pure bash code. Therefore, I use Python to implement it and more features will be added to it in the future. 

**For Windows users, software providing basic linux commands like `ssh` and `scp` is required, I recommend using [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).**

## Installation

Install from pypi:

```bash
pip install loon
```

Install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ShixiangWang/loon
```

## Usage

### Configuration

To access remote host without typing password, you have to generate ssh key with `ssh-keygen` command if it is not available.

```shell
$ ssh-keygen
```

Follow the commands, for simplicity, just type `ENTER` to proceed.

Copy your key to remote server, replace `user` with your `username` and `host` with your remote host ip address.

```shell
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host
```

### Host management

- Add a remote host

```shell
$ loon add -U wsx -H 127.0.0.1 -P 22
=> Added successfully!
# Default port is 22, so don't need to specify it
# And we can create a host alias, otherwise
# it is same as username of remote host
$ loon add -U wsx -H 127.0.0.2 -N host2      
=> Added successfully!
```

- List all remote hosts

```shell
$ loon list
+-----+--------+----------+----+
|Alias|Username|IP address|Port|
+-----+--------+----------+----+
|<wsx>|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |
+-----+--------+----------+----+
|host2|wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |
+-----+--------+----------+----+
<active host>
```

- Rename alias

```shell
$ loon rename wsx host1
$ loon list
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|<host1>|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|host2  |wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |
+-------+--------+----------+----+
<active host>
```

- Switch active remote host

```shell
$ loon switch -N host2
=> Activated.
$ loon list
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|host1  |wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|<host2>|wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |
+-------+--------+----------+----+
<active host>
```

- Delete a host

```shell
$ loon delete -N host2
=> Removing host from available list...
=> Removing active host...
=> Changing active host to host1
$ loon list
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|
+-------+--------+----------+----+
|<host1>|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |
+-------+--------+----------+----+
<active host>
```

### Common tasks

- Run commands

```shell
$ loon run 'ls -l ~'
total 168
drwxr-xr-x     2 wsx liulab     25 Apr  7 23:26 bin

```

- Run local scripts

This will upload scripts to remote host firstly, then run them.

```shell
$ loon run -f ../../tests/scripts/t*.py
=> Starting upload...

t1.py                                          100%   50    49.0KB/s   00:00    
t2.py                                          100%   50    77.6KB/s   00:00    

=> Finished uploading in 1s
=> Getting results:
This is t1 script.
This is t2 script.
```

- If input contains both files and directories, all files in directory will not be executed. This is a way to include child scripts which does not need to be executed. 
- If input is only a directory, all scripts (not including scripts in subdirectories) under it will be executed. This is the way to maintain an independent project.

You can include data directory using `--data` flag, specify program like `bash` or `python` using `--prog` flag and set remote directory using `--dir` flag.

- Upload and download files 

Use them like `cp` command.

```shell
$ loon upload -h
usage: loon upload [-h] [-v] source [source ...] destination

positional arguments:
  source         Source files to upload
  destination    Remote destination directory, note '~' should be quoted in
                 some cases

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  set loglevel to INFO

$ loon download -h
usage: loon download [-h] [-v] source [source ...] destination

positional arguments:
  source         Source files to download
  destination    Local destination directory, note '~' should be quoted in
                 some cases

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  set loglevel to INFO
```

### PBS management and tasks

* `pbstemp` - Generate a PBS template file
* `pbsgen`  - Generate a batch of PBS files
* `pbsgen_example` - Generate example files for pbsgen command
* `pbssub` - Submit PBS tasks
* `pbscheck` - Check status of PBS job on remote host

More details please see `-h` option of the commands above.
